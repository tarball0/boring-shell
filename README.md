# `boring-shell`

I called it the boring shell because there isn't really anything special about it. I mean, you would be better off using literally any other shell.  
  
It doesn't have any colourful ways of telling you what kind of file it is, there's no autocomplete, no history, no pipes, no scripting support, no neat tricks, nothing. Like I said, do not use this shell. 

Would I add any of these things? Maybe. If I feel like it. One day.

This was just a little one-day project to teach myself gcc inline assembly and forking in c, which I can say I achieved (The bare minimum, at least.)

## Running
you know how to use gcc.
