# `boring-shell`

I called it the boring shell because there isn't really anything special about it. I mean, you would be better off using literally any other shell.  

This was just a little one-day project to teach myself gcc inline assembly and forking in c, which I can say I achieved (The bare minimum, at least.)

## Running
run `make` inside the directory and `./boring`  

(you might need to install gnu readline idk)

### ?
what on earth even is POSIX?
