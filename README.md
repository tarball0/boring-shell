# `boring-shell`
A very barebones, basic CLI shell. Integrated with [Clearch](https://github.com/The-Capstone-Project/Clearch)!  
Everytime an unknown command is passed, it gets redirected to clearch to provide helpful insight and corrections.
This way you can directly ask the shell questions and receive help without sacrificing it's core functionality.
